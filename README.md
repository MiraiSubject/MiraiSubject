# Hello, I'm Shivam!
## About me

- üñ•Ô∏è Full stack software engineer
- üìÜ 13 years of experience doing software development (have been learning since I was 13)
- üáØüáµ Studying Japanstudies, with a minor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Leiden University (currently BA3)
- üéÅ All my open-source work is available here on GitHub

## What I'm up to

### Work

- Frontend Development for Ovotrack
  - Framework: Next.js 13 (Was Vue.js 2.7 & Sveltekit 1.x)
  - Tooling: Custom next.js config using a build middleware to dynamically set the base path depending on the target environment and a script to modify paths to a set URL after the bundle has been made (yes, this Next.js app will land on a platform that prefers relative paths, but Next.js doesn't support that scenario)
  - Previous Tooling: Self-made config with Webpack 5 and a community-made web component builder for Vue 2.x with added TypeScript support incorporated in [this builder](https://github.com/MiraiSubject/ixon-vue2-builder)
  - Language(s): Javascript, TypeScript
  - Notable achievements: Added custom tooling to streamline the development and deployment processes for the unconventional deployment target. 

### On the side

- Cosette: Full stack Tournament Management System (TMS) (Active development)
  - SSR Application: Nuxt.js v3
  - Backend (tentative): Express.js with GraphQL (API & Authentication)
  - Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
  - Object Storage: Cloudflare R2
  - Language(s): TypeScript, possibly Rust

- Yuzu: Multi-provider anime list manager for iOS (On-hold)
  - Native application originally written using UIKit
  - Currently undergoing a transformation to SwiftUI
  - As of today, sucessfully interfaces with Anilist and Kitsu

## Projects I've worked on
- Student app for my high school (2012)
  - An app for high school to read schedules, plan classes and to access the LMS
  - Later released: Android app (2012) using `Android App Creator` for cross-platform compatibility.
  - Language(s): Objective-C

## Experiments
These are projects that I worked on by myself but never saw completion.
<details>
<summary>List of experiments</summary>

- UMGOptions (2015) `Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints` - experimenting with creating a GUI and modifying settings of the engine in-game.
- MiraiRunner (2015) `Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints` - futuristic autorunner game (like Temple Run)
- Shiro (2016) `Javascript/Electron` - Frontend for `livestreamer` CLI tool. One of the notable features was the ease of use with authenticated endpoints like Crunchyroll using the user's subscription.
