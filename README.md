# Hello, I'm Shivam!
## About me

- 🖥️ Full stack software engineer
- 📆 14 years of experience doing software development (have been learning since I was 13)
- 🇯🇵 Graduated from Japanstudies, together with a minor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Leiden University

## What I'm up to

### Work

- Frontend Development for Ovotrack
  - Frameworks: Next.js 14 & Sveltekit 2
  - Tooling:
    - Custom next.js config using a build middleware to dynamically set the base path depending on the target environment and a script to modify paths to a set URL after the bundle has been made (yes, this Next.js app will land on a platform that prefers relative paths, but Next.js doesn't support that scenario)
    - Regular Sveltekit app deployed a docker container
  - Previous Tooling:
    - Self-made config with Webpack 5 and a community-made web component builder for Vue 2.x with added TypeScript support incorporated in [this builder](https://github.com/MiraiSubject/ixon-vue2-builder)
  - Language(s): TypeScript, React, Vue, Svelte
  - Notable achievements:
    - Added custom tooling to streamline the development and deployment processes for the unconventional deployment target.
    - Help improve frontend development processes w.r.t. teamwork, code style and programming patterns.

### On the side

- Cosette: Full stack Tournament Management System (TMS) (Active development)
  - SSR Application: Svelte 5
  - Backend: Sveltekit 2
  - Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle

- Yuzu: Multi-provider anime list manager and sync tool (TBD)

## Experiments
These are projects that I worked on by myself but never saw completion.
<details>
<summary>List of experiments</summary>

- UMGOptions (2015) `Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints` - experimenting with creating a GUI and modifying settings of the engine in-game.
- MiraiRunner (2015) `Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints` - futuristic autorunner game (like Temple Run)
- Shiro (2016) `Javascript/Electron` - Frontend for `livestreamer` CLI tool. One of the notable features was the ease of use with authenticated endpoints like Crunchyroll using the user's subscription.
